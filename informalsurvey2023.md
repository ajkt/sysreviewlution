# An Informal Community Survey on Research Synthesis & Systematic Reviews
*by Katja Rogers and Katie Seaborn*

As part of the alt.chi presentation, but also advertised more widely through social media (Twitter, Mastodon, various Slacks), we are gathering community responses on what HCI expects from systematic reviews: what they can look like and what they can result in.  

The survey is available here: [https://bit.ly/3oBteKA](https://bit.ly/3oBteKA) 

*We will summarize the results here in a few weeks (aiming for end of May).*
